# Some known bugs in no order
Doesn't always know when Shodan key init fails.
Doesn't know (or care) when a search returns no results.
Doesn't handle all quoted search strings properly.
Gets hella confused by many symbols (ie poor filtering).
Functionality is kinda scattered. Needs refactoring.
Doesn't handle missing tools very well or at all in some cases.
The whole "-run-bg" scheme is crude and hokey. Just make script smarter.
Doesn't normalize order of search parameters; Directory names exactly match order of parameters, resulting in different directories for the same results if phrased differently.
A few calls to Perl, that's unfashionable and unportable.
Literally no clean-up features at all. :P
