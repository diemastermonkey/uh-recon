PROBABLY NOT READY FOR YOU YET

The "Uh-Recon" tools for pre-engagement reconnaissance.

Synopsis

These are some of the tools used by the Unhackers team in 
pre-engagement reconnaisance and related tasks. Using Shodan 
queries as a starting point, they gather various enrichment 
and summary data into collections stored in named subdirectories.

Additionally, they limit query API use by refreshing data at most 
once per day (soon to be configurable).

This functionality overlaps with those of interest to pen testers, 
bug hunters, security researchers. And you're welcome to them!

Requirements

BASH, Shodan CLI for your platform, Shodan API Key, Nrich, grep, and Perl

The Kit

  - Relies on Shodan and other tools and services
  - Is documented mostly in code
  - Is still a mess (but cleanup is active)
  - Includes example output directory/logs/etc
