# uh-recon

The "Uh-Recon" tools for pre-engagement reconnaissance.

PROBABLY NOT READY FOR YOU YET

## Synopsis
Tools used by the Unhackers team in pre-engagement reconnaisance and related tasks. 

Features:
* Does thing
* Includes example output directory/logs/etc

Un-Features:
* Minimal dependencies beyond Shodan CLI
* Still documented mostly in code
* Still a mess (but cleanup is active)

Synopsis


Using Shodan 
queries as a starting point, they gather various enrichment 
and summary data into collections stored in named subdirectories.
Additionally, they limit query API use by refreshing data at most 
once per day (soon to be configurable).

This functionality overlaps with those of interest to pen testers, 
bug hunters, security researchers. And you're welcome to them!

Requirements

BASH, Shodan CLI for your platform, Shodan API Key, Nrich, grep, and Perl
